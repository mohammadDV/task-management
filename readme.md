# Task Management project

This project is a **test project** that includes two complete **CRUD implementations** for **Projects and Tasks** associated with the projects. The backend is built using **Laravel 11**, and the frontend is developed with **HTML**, **CSS(Tailwind css)**, and **JavaScript (jQuery)**.

## Project Overview

The backend uses the **Repository Pattern** to separate business logic from data access.
For authentication, **two guards (web and api)** have been implemented, as the CRUD operations are structured as **RESTful APIs**.
The project structure covers all **CRUD operations**, including:
Creating, deleting, and listing Projects.
Creating, deleting, editing, and listing Tasks.

## Repository Pattern

This project is built using the **Repository Pattern** to separate business logic from data access. The binding of repositories to their corresponding interfaces is managed automatically within the **RepositoryServiceProvider** file.

### How it works:
The **RepositoryServiceProvider** scans the **App\Repositories** directory and binds each repository class to its interface.
- The **bindRepositoriesToInterfaces** method matches the repositories with their interfaces and registers them in **Laravelâ€™s service container** for easy dependency injection throughout the project.
- This structure ensures **clean architecture** and flexibility for future modifications.

## Testing Feature

A **complete test suite** for the **TaskRepository** has been implemented to validate the repository operations. You can run the tests using the following command:

```php
    php artisan test
```

This command will execute the test cases for various CRUD operations and confirm that the repository behaves as expected.
